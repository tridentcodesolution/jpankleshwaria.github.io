This directory contains upgrade scripts for various LedgerSMB and
SQL-Ledger versions.

Note that every upgrade (and downgrade) script *must* adhere to
the protocol which allows the script runner to determine success
or failure:

 Upon successful completion, the upgrade script must change
 the value associated with the setting_key 'migration_ok' to 'yes'.
