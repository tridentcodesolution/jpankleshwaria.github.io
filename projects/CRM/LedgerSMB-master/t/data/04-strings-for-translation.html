# These strings are here due to the fact that
# they'r undetectable by the string scanner: their use in the sources
# is combined with the 'gettext' function instead of text()/Text()
# and it would be too much effort to adjust the scanner to extract the
# second(!) argument of the gettext() function for just 3 strings
